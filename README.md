# CV-Project-3
A project for my CV demonstrating skills working with Microsoft Power BI. I used the "Global Crypto Currency Price Database" from Kaggle to make a Crypto Dashboard of over 6000 cryptocurrencies. I used SQL Server database with these data from my [previous project](https://github.com/Faleb/CV-Project-2/tree/main) to import them in Power BI. This project includes two pages. The main page contains the general information about prices and volumes of currencies, which change dynamicaly according to choosen date. The second page allows user to search for specific currency and check more information about low, high, and close prices. Also, it displays KPI(Key Performance Indicator) for each currency.
The report is too big for GitHub, so it can be found on [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N5mEF3L1kKqXHA9EYY4HP_xTH67cZcw8/view?usp=sharing).
